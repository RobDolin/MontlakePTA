## Proposed Process
1. Compile an inventory of current communication resources
2. Identify customers
3. Collect customer requirements via conversations (in-person, call, TXT, or email) and possibly a short survey
4. Evaluate potential tools
5. Based on customer requirements, recommend a set of tools at Jan 2020 Montlake PTA board meeting
